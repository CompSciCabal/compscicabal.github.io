Hi, everyone! 

Firstly, remember that this coming Friday, Jan 16, we're meeting at Sud Forno instead of Bento Miso. Very important!

Secondly, we now have a mailing list! Sign up here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cs-cabal

We've decided we're going to themes for the next few months. February is memory management. Leo has been volunteered to curate a list of GC-related papers, taking us from the beginnings of the field to the state of the art in three easy pieces. On the fourth week we'll all build our own garbage collectors! 

Coincidentally, February's theme ties in with the paper being read at our local Papers We Love meetup group, so be sure to check that out as well.

We'll be discussing themes and papers for future months on the mailing list, so make your voice heard there! The "What's Next?" wiki section has also been recently revamped, so feel free to add your ideas there as well.?
