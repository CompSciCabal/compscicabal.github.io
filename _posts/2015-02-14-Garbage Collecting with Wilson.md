Recap!

Friday night we had a great turnout for part 2 of Wilson's Uniprocessor garbage collection survey paper. Chris did a great job of taking us through some of the intricacies of generational garbage collection putting us in a good place to start reading next week's paper, "A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection"by Bacon, Cheng, and Rajan (http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-bacon/Bacon04Unified.pdf). We will meet at the usual time and place, Friday night at 6:30pm at Bento Miso.

Chris mentioned a couple of tools worth bringing up as I'm going to start playing with them as we work towards hopefully having some sort of garbage collector for show and tell day at the end of February. Chris gave a talk recently on McCarthy's paper, "Teaching Garbage Collection without Implementing Compilers and Interpretors" (http://jeapostrophe.github.io/home/static/cooper-sigcse2013.pdf) and the author's related environment for building a testing garbage collectors in racket, http://docs.racket-lang.org/plai/collector.html . Please add in the comments any other resources that may be useful.

Until next time,
Scott?
