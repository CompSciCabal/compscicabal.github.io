Hi Everyone!
We made it! Yesterday marked the end of our year long relationship with sicp, as we finished reading and discussing the final chapter. Though there may be no more pages to turn, I'm sure the ideas we've learned will continue to percolate for a long time to come.

Thanks Dann for taking the lead and taking on the moderation most of the time. And Andre thanks for being a champ and powering through all of the final chapter exercises, we spent a good chunk of the session reading over your code on github, too bad you couldn't make it.

Next week is the final celebratory session of the year, so we ask those attending to:
a) Bring some food as this is a celebration
b) go through the book again and pick out your favourite parts from each chapter to discuss and review.

In the new year, the plan is to shift from the single book deep dive approach and spend some time doing shallower dips into selected chapters or articles. Look on the github for the current list of ideas, or come out and join us in the new year and tell us what you are interested I reading.

Until next Time,
Scott
