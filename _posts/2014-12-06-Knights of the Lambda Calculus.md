We finished off the year with the awarding of the first official comp sci cabal pins (Thanks Leo!), recapping our favourite parts of sicp (impossible to choose so we took longer than usual), and enjoying ourselves with a few loved ones in attendance as well. Special mention should go to Andre's favourite footnote, footnote 6 of chapter 4.1.1, wherein the authors consider the notion of truth in a meta circular evaluator.

This takes us to a break for the holidays, and we will reconvene the Cabal on Friday January 9th around 6:30pm at the usual location of Bento Miso. Dann is going to moderate a discussion of Phil Bagwell's paper "Ideal Hash Trees", http://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf .

This is a great opportunity for newcomers to join the group as in the new year we are starting out by covering a wider variety of shorter papers, excerpts, or chapters, rather than starting another epic like sicp right away.

Until next time, Happy Holidays Everyone! ?
