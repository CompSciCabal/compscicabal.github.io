Hey Everyone!
Friday night we covered the first two sections of Milner's famous paper, "A Theory of Type Polymorphism in Programming", the conversational sections.

Next week we will continue on, I don't think we picked a specific stopping point, as far as you can get is good. We will meet at the same time and place, Friday night at 6:30pm at Bento Miso.

Pete has taken the lead on this paper and I encourage everyone to check out his summary notes on github, https://github.com/CompSciCabal/SMRTYPRTY/wiki/Paper!-Milner-Type-Polymorphism . He does a great job at summarizing the main ideas in the paper so far. It seems like this paper formulates some of the ideas like soundness and completeness in a more clear way than we have seen before in our other readings.

Looking forward to seeing you all on Friday,
Scott?
