title: A Reasoned Schemer Talk, Then On To The Little Typer
---

Since our [last update](/2022/05/26/We're-Still-Alive.html), the group has finished reading the Seasoned Schemer as well as The Reasoned Schemer, which we attempted (successfully, but occasionally painfully) to do in clojure using core.logic.

On Nov. 14, John will be sharing a talk on lessons learned from the Reasoned Schemer, so if you're around in Toronto come hang out! Unfortunately this will be an in person event only. Guild link [here]((https://guild.host/events/lessons-from-the-reasoned-rt1bhn))

Starting this Thursday (Oct 5 2023) we'll be back on zoom (and Dr Racket) reading [The Little Typer](https://thelittletyper.com/), if you're interested in joining, join the guild page [here](https://guild.host/events/the-little-typer-reading-p2183h).
